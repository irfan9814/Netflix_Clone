## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
The purpose of this Netflix clone front-end project is to replicate the look and feel of the popular streaming service's website. By creating a clone of the Netflix front-end, developers can practice building real-world web applications with popular front-end frameworks React. This project also serves as an opportunity to learn about modern web development concepts such as data fetching from APIs, and using third-party libraries.

Furthermore, the Netflix clone can be used as a portfolio project to showcase a developer's skills to potential employers or clients. It demonstrates their ability to work with complex front-end frameworks, build responsive web pages, and implement advanced features like video playback. By creating a fully functional clone of a popular website like Netflix, developers can showcase their creativity and attention to detail while also demonstrating their technical skills in a practical, real-world context.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Visual Studio Code
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```

And repeat

```
until finished
```


## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
